In XML, elements are used to define and structure data, and attributes are used to provide
additional information about elements. There are several rules that must be followed when naming
 and using elements and attributes in XML documents:

- Element names must begin with a letter or underscore, and can only contain letters, numbers,
 underscores, hyphens, and periods. For example, the element name "customer_name" is valid, but
  "1st_customer" is not.

- Element names are case-sensitive, so "customer" is different from "Customer".

- Attribute names must also begin with a letter or underscore, and can only contain letters,
numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods. For example, the attribute name "customer_id" is
valid, but "1st_customer" is not.

- Attribute names are also case-sensitive, so "customer_id" is different from "Customer_id".

- Attribute names must be unique within the element they are associated with. For example, if an
 attribute named "customer_id" is already used for a "customer" element, a different attribute name
  must be used for another customer, such as "customer_number".

Example:
<customer customer_id="123456" customer_name="John Doe">
    <address>
        <street>123 Main St</street>
        <city>New York</city>
        <state>NY</state>
        <zip>10001</zip>
    </address>
    <order order_id="987654">
        <item>
            <name>Shirt</name>
            <quantity>1</quantity>
            <price>19.99</price>
        </item>
        <item>
            <name>Pants</name>
            <quantity>2</quantity>
            <price>29.99</price>
        </item>
    </order>
</customer>
In this example, the "customer" element has two attributes: "customer_id" and "customer_name".
The "address" and "order" elements also have unique attribute names
("street", "city", "state", "zip", "order_id", "name", "quantity", and "price").
