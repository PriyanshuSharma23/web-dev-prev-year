<!-- DOM (Document object model) -->
<!--
    It is representaion of UI in the form of nodes and trees
    every thing presented on the screen is a node and and
    nodes are related to each other using Tree.

    DOM is language independent, which means it can be generated by
    XML, HTML or anyother language.

    DOM is used by web browsers to display a website

<script>
  // Javascript has a very powerful DOM manipulation API
  // We can do everything in JS with the help of DOM manipulations
  // Sunch as creating elemets, accessing existing elements,
  // modifying properties on existing elements

  // For manipulating the dom we first select the DOM Node (HTMLElement)
  // There are neumerous ways to do this task, such as getElementById, getElementByTagName
  // getElementById, querySelector, querySelectorAll and many more
  const domNode = document.querySelector('body');

  // Then we have the domNode and we can do soo many things with it
  // such as
  // adding text
  domNode.innerText = "Hello World";

  // we can also create nodes
  const child = document.createElement('p');
  child.innerHTML = "This is child p tag";

  // then we can add child
  domNode.appendChild(child);

  // we can manipulate styles
  child.style.color = green;

  // we can add event listeners
  domNode.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('domNode was clicked!');
  })

  // There is an unlimited potential with JS
</script>
