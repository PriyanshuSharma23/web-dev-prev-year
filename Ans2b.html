  //  Diff b/w == and ===

  //     Since JS is a dynamically typed programming language, it introduced some
  //     weird features when it was introduced such as
  //

  //   == only check value equality
  1 == '1' // true
  0 == false // true

  //  As the JS ecosystem grew, these `features` in JS turned out to be
  //  very bug prone, so JS added a === which also check type equality as well as value eqaulity
  1 === '1' // fasle
